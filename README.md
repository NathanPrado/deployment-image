# deployment-image
This is my Docker Image I use for the purpose of executing deployments in my homelab.

# Why?
I grew tired of keeping my laptop and desktop in sync when I wanted to perform an action on my homelab.  Pulling this image wherever I required just made more sense.  I might even place this in a local k3s cluster if I have a need for it.
